* Writing tests against the stdlib

The test framework for masterfiles piggy backs on the test framework from core.
It's important to note =plucked.cf.sub= comes from the core repository and that
it includes bodies and bundles from the stdlib which are useful in writing tests
in core. This presents a problem for writing tests in the masterfiles framework
because =plucked.cf.sub= is included and simply including the stdlib could
result in duplicate definition of bundle errors.

To work around this complication you can create a subtest that includes the
stdlib directly, but does not include the rest of the test framework.

** Example test

This is the main test. Note how it includes =default.cf.sub= and runs the
typical test bundlesequence. The test passes based on the *OUTPUT* of the
subtest which runs from a policy file with the same name suffixed with =.sub=.

#+Name: lib/reports/head.cf
#+BEGIN_SRC cfengine3
body common control
{
        inputs => { '../../default.cf.sub' };
        bundlesequence  => { default("$(this.promise_filename)") };
        version => "1.0";
}

bundle agent test
{
  meta:
      "description" string => "
Test that body printfile head works as expected";

}
bundle agent check
{
  vars:
      "pass_reg" string => ".*R: My first line
R: line 0
R: line 1
R: line 2
R: line 3
R: line 4
R: line 5
R: line 6
R: line 7
R: line 8
R: line 9";

      "command" string => "$(sys.cf_agent) -K -f $(this.promise_filename).sub";

  methods:
      "" usebundle => dcs_passif_output("$(pass_reg)", "", $(command), $(this.promise_filename));
}
#+END_SRC

This is the subtest itself. Note how it *does not include the test framework*
(=default.cf.sub=) but instead includes the part of the standard library that it
needs for the test. In this case the subtest outputs information that the main
test inspects for pass or failure. The main test could also inspect data in
other files. Consider writing a data file containing the =datastate()= or
=bundlestate()= of the subtest and having the main test use that to determine
pass or failure.

#+Name: lib/reports/head.cf.sub
#+BEGIN_SRC cfengine3
body file control
{
      # Include the stdlib directly so that we are always testing the most
      # recent version
        inputs => { '../../../../lib/reports.cf' };
}

bundle agent main
{
  reports:
    "My first line"
      printfile => head( "$(this.promise_dirname)/printfile.txt");
}
